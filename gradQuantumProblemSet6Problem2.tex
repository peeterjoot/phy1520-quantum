You have to add angular momenta \( j_1 = 1 \) and \( j_2 = 2 \) to form total angular momentum states with \( j = 1,2,3\).  There are a total of \( 15 \) \( \ket{j,m} \) states in the total angular momentum basis.  Express each of them in terms of the old basis \( \ket{j_1, j_2 ; m_1, m_2 } \) set.
