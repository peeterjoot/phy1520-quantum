- lecture 16: BL -> capL
- change any (attached) references to nbref
- scanned figures really bloat things.
- make rule for mathematica.tex should depend on mathematica/METADATA
- convert mathematica href link to github to internal mathematica.tex link
- use mathLabelBoxes instead of underbrace
- almost no indexing anywhere.
- introduce logical sections for lecture headings.  Perhaps move density operator into chapter III notes.
