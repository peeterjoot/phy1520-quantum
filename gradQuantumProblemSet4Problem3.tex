Consider the 1D Dirac Hamiltonian as

\begin{dmath}\label{eqn:gradQuantumProblemSet4Problem3:21}
H =
\begin{bmatrix}
c \hatp + V(x) & m c^2 \\
m c^2 & - c \hatp + V(x)
\end{bmatrix}
\end{dmath}

where the operator \( \hatp = - i \Hbar \PDi{x}{} \) is the rest mass, and \( c \) is the speed of light, and with 2-component wavefunctions

\begin{dmath}\label{eqn:gradQuantumProblemSet4Problem3:41}
\Psi(x,t) \equiv
\begin{bmatrix}
\psi_1(x, t) \\
\psi_2(x, t) \\
\end{bmatrix}
\end{dmath}

such that \( i \Hbar \PDi{t}{\Psi(x,t)} = H \Psi(x, t) \).  Assuming a potential step, where \( V(x < 0) = 0 \) and \( V(x > 0) = V_0 \), with \( V_0 > 0 \) as in class, complete the details of the scattering onto the step which was done in class. Discuss the incident current, reflected current, and transmitted current for the case where the incident energy is such that \( E > 0 \) and \( V_0 > 2 m c^2 \) , and \( E > 0 \) and \( V_0 < 2 m c^2 \). Draw pictures to illustrate the parabola and the location in momentum of the incident and reflected particles.
