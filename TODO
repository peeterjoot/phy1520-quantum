- revisit rod balancing problem (still in ../blogit).  Perhaps try particle on a table problem first.

- revisit the Sakurai "tricky problem" from chapter 5, discussed in tutorial.

- look for and fix any FIXMEs

- Hat's:
   - have a strange mix of hats and no-hats throughout.
   - \hat{\BL} looks weird. (but \hat{L} looks okay).  Attempted to fix in peeters_macros.sty by converting hat's into widehat's, but reverted it.

- some sections need to be merged to deal with lecture boundary interference.

- Parmekanti to send his notes for merge.

- should zitterbewegung be always capitalized (it would be in German, does that carry over?)

- why was I able to have usepackage{censor} in ../ece1254/thisbook.sty, but it didn't work for ../phy1520redacted/ ?

- need to apply redaction to the problem set subset of mathematica.tex
