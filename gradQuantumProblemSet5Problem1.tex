Consider a spin-1 particle. Even with time-reversal invariance, there is no Kramers theorem, so each eigenvalue of
a generic spin-1 Hamiltonian will be non-degenerate. Systematically construct a Hamiltonian which is time-reversal
invariant and obviously also Hermitian to illustrate this point, making clear the logic of your construction (i.e., why you are including terms which you are including).

One representation of the spin-one \( J_z \) operator is

\begin{dmath}\label{eqn:gradQuantumProblemSet5Problem1:20}
J_z
=
\Hbar
\begin{bmatrix}
1 & 0 & 0 \\
0 & 0 & 0 \\
0 & 0 & -1 \\
\end{bmatrix}
\end{dmath}

This operator changes sign under time reversal.  The \( L_z \) operator also changes sign under time reversal, and can be written

\begin{dmath}\label{eqn:gradQuantumProblemSet5Problem1:40}
L_z = -i \Hbar \PD{\phi}{}
\end{dmath}

A product of these will be time reversal invariant, but not Hermitian.  To make it Hermitian we can scale with an imaginary constant

\begin{dmath}\label{eqn:gradQuantumProblemSet5Problem1:60}
H
= -\frac{i}{2 m \rho^2} J_z L_z
= -\frac{i (-i \Hbar) \Hbar}{2m \rho^2}
\begin{bmatrix}
1 & 0 & 0 \\
0 & 0 & 0 \\
0 & 0 & -1 \\
\end{bmatrix} \PD{\phi}{}
=
-\frac{\Hbar^2}{2m \rho^2}
\begin{bmatrix}
\partial_\phi & 0 & 0 \\
0 & 0 & 0 \\
0 & 0 & -\partial_\phi \\
\end{bmatrix}.
\end{dmath}

A \( \ifrac{1}{2 m \rho^2} \) factor has been included to ensure the dimensions of this spin-one time-reversal invariant Hamiltonian also has the dimensions of energy.

This Hamiltonian can be solved directly using the trial function \( \psi = e^{-i E t/\Hbar} \tilde{\psi} \), which provides an eigenvalue equation

\begin{dmath}\label{eqn:gradQuantumProblemSet5Problem1:80}
E \tilde{\psi} = H \tilde{\psi},
\end{dmath}

leading to solutions that have a hyperbolic form

\begin{dmath}\label{eqn:gradQuantumProblemSet5Problem1:100}
\psi \propto
\begin{bmatrix}
C e^{-2 m \rho^2 E \phi/\Hbar^2} \\
0 \\
C' e^{2 m \rho^2 E \phi/\Hbar^2} \\
\end{bmatrix}
e^{-i E t/\Hbar}
.
\end{dmath}

Consistent with the no-Kramer's theorem result for a spin-one Hamiltonian, there is a continuum of energy solutions for this Hamiltonian, with nothing to constrain them.
